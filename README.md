# Performance Analysis of Real-Time Extended and Unscented Kalman Filters

This paper performs a deep Performance Analysis of the most utilised filters for prediction estimation on tracking systems which are the _Extended Kalman Filter_ (_EKF_) and the _Unscented Kalman filter_ (_UKF_). A real-time simulation is used to compare both filters and praise the advantages of each approach, where both are compared with their respective _MATLAB_ function. All the performed scenarios aim to test the capabilities of the filters in a real-life scenario and, in the end, discover what are the best conditions to use each method.
